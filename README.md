# Stiffness Matrix for 2D Structures
This repository contains Python scripts designed for the analysis of 2D truss structures and bending elements (frames) using the Direct Stiffness Matrix Method. The scripts calculate the displacements of each node and determine the strains and stresses in each element.
# Overview
The provided Python scripts analyze 2D structures by:

1-Calculating the displacement of each node.

2-Determining the strains and stresses in each element.

The method used is the Direct Stiffness Matrix Method.

# How to use
